    <h3>RESEARCH:</h3>
    <h4>Post-Millennial Pop Music Corpus Analysis</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Collaborated with UMass's Music Department on corpus-based research of the top 50 songs of the past 20 years.
        </li>
        <li>
            Analyzed corpus using k-means clustering in R to group songs together based on rhythmic similarity.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed <a href="https://github.com/hyukjekwon/textgrid_edit" target="_top">Python scripts and tools</a> to automate portions of the song annotation process for current and future research participants.
        </li>
        <li>
            Consolidated old data sets and standardized annotation formats of over 70 songs to improve further analysis of the corpus.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yWkqtEebtMEsqp_YbgzpuTm1WE0y_UZW?usp=sharing" target="_top"><h4>chordHMM</h4></a>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Collaborated with UMass Music Professor Chris White to update an old hidden markov model (HMM) from Python 2 to Python 3.
        </li>
        <li>
            chordHMM trains and tests on a corpus of chords, and then spits out the best number of HMM hidden states with transition and emission probabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Integrated the Python script into a Google Colab.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>It's Not Easy Being Green</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Working with UMass's PLASMA lab.
        </li>
        <li>
            Researching and correcting claims made by various papers on the energy efficiency of different programming languages.
        </li>
        <li>
            Currently planning to publish paper in October 2023.
